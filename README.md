# Xylophone
SwiftUI Xylophone
This application is a simple Xylophone application. 
The original idea (and the musical assets) were taken from The London App Brewery's iOS Class.
(although it was written in Swift, not SwiftUI). 
I have updated to SwiftUI, and made some improvements, such as: 
1. The keys are dynamic (it even looks great on iPad!)
2. Custom font has been installed and used
3. You can toggle between different color sets
